# 🏆 Unified Sentiment Intelligence Dashboard

### 🧭 Objective
Combine product reviews, survey feedback, and social media data to build a 360° sentiment intelligence view for decision-makers.

### ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy) • SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL) • Power BI / Tableau

### 🧠 Steps Performed
1. Consolidated datasets from previous projects into a master table.  
2. Normalized sentiment scores and joined datasets by brand/category.  
3. Loaded merged dataset into Power BI.  
4. Designed multi-source dashboard:
   - Sentiment breakdown by source (Reviews, Surveys, Social)
   - Keyword overlap analysis
   - Cross-platform trend visualization

### 📊 Insights
- Product reviews are generally more positive than social media sentiment.  
- Survey feedback provides more nuanced emotions (trust, dissatisfaction).
